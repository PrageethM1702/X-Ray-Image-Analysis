# X-Ray-Image-Analysis
This project uses a fine-tuned convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify pneumonia in chest X-ray images. Key features include data augmentation, advanced visualization, and evaluation using precision-recall and ROC metrics. It leverages TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and other libraries for robust performance.
